# Dota 2 Bot Scripts - Claude Code Guide

## Project Overview

This is the **dota2bot-OpenHyperAI** project -- Lua bot scripts for Dota 2 that run in custom lobbies. Currently supports Patch 7.41f with 127 heroes.

## Key Documentation

- **[docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)** -- Complete codebase architecture, file map, naming conventions, all systems explained
- **[docs/PATCH_UPDATE_GUIDE.md](docs/PATCH_UPDATE_GUIDE.md)** -- Step-by-step runbook for updating when a new Dota 2 patch drops
- **[docs/D2PT_BUILD_UPDATES.md](docs/D2PT_BUILD_UPDATES.md)** -- Hero-by-hero rebuilds from Dota2ProTracker data (`BotLib/Builds/`), position weight formula, validation

**Read these docs FIRST before making any changes.** They contain everything needed to make targeted updates without scanning the entire repo.

## Common Tasks

### Check for New Patches

To check if there are patches we haven't updated for:
1. Fetch `https://www.dota2.com/datafeed/patchnoteslist?language=english`
2. Compare latest version against "Last updated for" in `docs/PATCH_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`
3. If newer patch exists, follow the update process below

### Patch Update (most common)

When user says "update for patch X.XX" or provides patch notes:

1. Read `docs/PATCH_UPDATE_GUIDE.md` for the step-by-step process
2. Fetch patch data: `https://www.dota2.com/datafeed/patchnotes?version=X.XX&language=english`
3. Fetch d2vpkr data (shops.txt, neutral_items.txt) for authoritative item/ability names
4. **Categorize changes**: STRUCTURAL (need code) vs NUMBER-ONLY (game API handles) vs TALENT SWAPS
5. **Always verify ability names on Liquipedia** -- patch note summaries can be wrong; diffing d2vpkr against the previous patch shows what really changed (guide section 1C-2)
6. Follow the checklist in order: items -> hero builds -> abilities -> neutrals -> actives -> map changes
7. **Always update TS sources** for any TS-generated Lua files changed (see ARCHITECTURE.md Section 13)

### Add a New Hero

1. Copy a similar existing hero from `bots/BotLib/` as template
2. Add to `FretBots/HeroNames.lua`, `FunLib/aba_hero_roles_map.lua`, `FunLib/spell_list.lua`
3. See "New Heroes" section in `docs/PATCH_UPDATE_GUIDE.md`

### Fix a Hero's Item Build

1. Read `bots/BotLib/hero_[name].lua`
2. Legacy heroes: edit the `sRoleItemsBuyList['pos_N']` arrays. Heroes with a `bots/BotLib/Builds/[name].lua` file were rebuilt from D2PT: edit `X.sBuyList` following `docs/D2PT_BUILD_UPDATES.md`, and don't re-pick their items/talents by hand during patch updates
3. Items use `item_[internal_name]` format -- check `FunLib/aba_item.lua` for valid names
4. Run `node tests/run-builds.cjs` (build validator + specs)

### Fix a Hero's Ability Logic

1. Read `bots/BotLib/hero_[name].lua`
2. The `SkillsComplement()` function controls ability casting priority
3. Each ability has a `ConsiderX()` function returning desire + target
4. See "Skill / Ability System" in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## Important Rules

- **Use `GetItemComponents()` for item recipes** -- don't hardcode component arrays
- **Use `sAbilityList[N]` references** when possible -- resilient to ability renames
- **Always update BOTH neutral item files** (Buff/ AND FretBots/)
- **Verify on Liquipedia** before trusting patch note summaries about ability names
- **Test in-game** after changes -- some things can only be verified at runtime

## Backlog.md Workflow

This project uses Backlog.md for task and project management.

**At the beginning of each conversation in this project, run `backlog instructions overview` before answering or taking action. Re-read it only if you have not read it yet in the current conversation.**

Use the overview to decide whether to search, read, create, or update Backlog tasks.

Before task lifecycle actions, read the matching detailed guide:
- `backlog instructions task-creation` before creating or splitting tasks
- `backlog instructions task-execution` before planning, changing status or assignee, adding a plan or implementation notes, or implementing task work
- `backlog instructions task-finalization` before checking acceptance criteria, writing final summaries, or moving tasks to terminal statuses

Use `backlog <command> --help` before running unfamiliar commands. Help shows options, fields, and examples.

Do not edit Backlog task, draft, document, decision, or milestone markdown files directly. Use the `backlog` CLI so metadata, relationships, and history stay consistent.
